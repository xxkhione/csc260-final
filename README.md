CSC260-Final
This repository contains the final project for a CSC260 course, completed approximately 5 months ago.

The project is a Video Game Library application, written primarily in C#, with additional components in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The primary objective of the project is to demonstrate an understanding of the concepts taught in the course by creating a functional application.

I will be adding new functionality to this project, including microservices, and, if time allows, fixing common problems with using built-in identities by utilizing a third-party service instead.
