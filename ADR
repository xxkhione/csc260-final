Repo Name: csc260-final (accepted)
Context: Add 2 features in ~2 weeks
Other repos considered: lobehub/lobe-chat
Decision reason: Picked this repo because, given the timeframe, it will be easier to add a new feature without dealing with a large number of pre-existing components and features like the other repo had. Having experience in this codebase,
It will be easier to implement new changes and break it apart into two microservices.
